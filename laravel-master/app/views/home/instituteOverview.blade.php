		<p class="lead">The Global Forum on Technology in Higher Education (GFHTE) is proud to sponsor its first International Leadership Institute on Technology in Higher Education in Marakech, Morocco.</p>

		<p>Drawing on the expertise of academic leaders from around the world, the Institute provides the ideal forum for academic department chairs, deans, provosts and information technology administrators to learn about how to meet the leadership challenges for the management and implementation of new technologies in higher education. From increasing demands for online course offerings to the utilization of MOOCs in curriculum development, the Leadership Institute will empower academic leaders to build capacity, share best practices and network with colleagues from around the world.</p>
		<p>Set in the historical and culturally rich city of <a href="{{ route('location') }}">Marakech</a>, and locally co-hosted by the internationally renowned <a href="http://www.uh2c.ac.ma/uh2c/index.php">Hassan II University</a>, the Leadership Institute also provides an exciting cosmopolitan experience for presenters. In addition to a robust program of panels and related sessions, participants and their guests can take advantage of planned and included tours and events that highlight fascinating dimensions of Moroccan history, culture and cuisine.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the Institute is to enable academic leaders to develop a clear roadmap for refining and implementing visionary strategies on technology in higher education. Participants will be able to share their experiences and expertise, as well as to return to their home institutions with meaningful practical application strategies. Institute opportunities and outcomes will include planning sessions where attendees can participate in developing future broad-based conferences for faculty.</p>
		<p>Join us in setting the foundations for academics to meet the challenges we face in making the most of dynamic new opportunities for managing technology in higher education.</p>
